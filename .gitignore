Components of Hadoop 1.x :
                   > Name node
                   > Secondary Name node
                   > Data node
                   > Job Tracker
                   > Task Tracker
Name Node          :
                    Contains the HDFS tree and other metadata information about files and directories.
                    Contains in-memory mapping of which blocks are store in which datanode.
Secondary Namenode :
                    Performs house-keeping activities for Namenode, like periodic merging of namespace and edits.
                    It is not a backup of Namenode.
Datanode           :
                    Stores actual data of files in HDFS on its local disk.
                    Sends signal to Namenode periodically to verify if it is active.
                    It is the workhouse of the system.
                    It also sends block reporting to the Namenode on cluster startup as well as periodically at every 10th heartbeat
                    DataNode performs all the block operations, including periodic checksum. It receives instruction from the namenode of where to put the blocks and how to put the blocks.
Job Tracker        :
                    Controls overall execution of map reduce jobs.
Task Trackers      :
                    Runs individual map-reduce jobs on datanodes.
                    Periodically communicates with the jobtracker to give updates and receive instructions.
